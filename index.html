                    <p>In 1828, Robin Swift arrives at Oxford University as the ward of the mysterious Professor Lovell. There, he discovers a world of dark academia where translation is not just an academic pursuit, but a form of magic that powers the British Empire's dominance.</p>
                    
                    <p>At Babel, Oxford's Royal Institute of Translation, students manipulate silver bars through the precise art of translation, creating magical effects that fuel Britain's industrial and military might. But this power comes at a terrible cost.</p>
                    
                    <p>As Robin delves deeper into the world of silver-working, he uncovers the violent foundation upon which the Institute—and the Empire itself—is built. When revolution comes to Oxford, Robin must choose between the world that has made him and the world he could help create.</p>

            <h3>The Raw Silver</h3>
            <p>
              All silver begins as a <strong>pure bar of unmarked metal</strong>, mined from colonies across the globe 
              and shipped back to Britain. In its natural state, silver is nothing more than a <em>conduit</em> — 
              highly conductive, yet inert without the work of language.
            </p>
            <p>
              Raw silver bars are carefully refined and polished until they gleam with a mirror-like surface. 
              They hold no power of their own, but their very purity allows them to store the <strong>linguistic paradoxes</strong> 
              that fuel Babel’s magic.
            </p>
            <p>
              It is said that even before engraving, silver seems to hum faintly in silence, as if waiting to be spoken into.
            </p>

        <!-- Engraved Silver Bar -->

            <img src="res/engraved-silverbar.jpg" alt="Engraved Silver Bar">
          </div>
          <div class="silver-text">
            <h3>The Engraved Silver</h3>
            <p>
              The bar’s true power emerges when it is engraved with <strong>word pairs</strong> from different languages. 
              These inscriptions capture the <em>gaps in translation</em> — the subtle differences between meaning that 
              no language can fully bridge. The silver stores this unspoken tension and releases it as usable energy.
            </p>
            <p>
              On its own, an engraved silver bar glows faintly, resonating with the words etched into its surface. 
              But when <strong>attached to an object</strong> — a lamp post, a carriage, even an entire building — 
              the bar channels its energy into practical function: brighter light, smoother travel, or reinforced strength.
            </p>
            <p>
              Over time, engraved silver is not eternal. Should the surface become <strong>damaged, corroded, or worn</strong>, 
              the inscriptions lose clarity, and the paradox unravels. A broken bar falls silent — disposable, no longer 
              able to sustain its magic.

        <h2>Lifecycle of a Silver Bar</h2>
        <div class="timeline">
          <!-- Stage 1: Raw Silver -->
          <div class="timeline-item">
            <div class="timeline-icon">1</div>
            <div class="timeline-content">
              <h3>Raw Silver</h3>
              <p>
                Extracted from deep mines across the empire, raw silver holds immense
                potential but remains inert. Only when engraved with carefully chosen
                translation pairs does it awaken its latent resonance. At this stage, it is
                precious but powerless.
              </p>
            </div>
          </div>
      
          <!-- Stage 2: Engraving -->
          <div class="timeline-item">
            <div class="timeline-icon">2</div>
            <div class="timeline-content">
              <h3>Engraving</h3>
              <p>
                Translators inscribe words from different languages onto the bar, binding
                their tension and difference. The <em>gap</em> between meanings releases
                energy, turning the silver into a conduit of hidden power. Each engraving is
                unique, suited for specific functions — from heating a kettle to fueling
                great engines.
              </p>
            </div>
          </div>
      
          <!-- Stage 3: Active Use -->
          <div class="timeline-item">
            <div class="timeline-icon">3</div>
            <div class="timeline-content">
              <h3>Active Use</h3>
              <p>
                Once embedded into objects — a lamp post, a carriage, a printing press — the
                engraved bar continuously channels energy, sustaining its effect without
                fuel or flame. This resonance is subtle yet constant: a lamp glows brighter
                than any oil flame, doors lock with unseen strength, and carriages move
                smoother than mere wood and wheel allow. However, each bar hums with finite
                life, slowly wearing as its engraved words exhaust their tension.
              </p>
            </div>
          </div>
      
          <!-- Stage 4: Maintenance -->
          <div class="timeline-item">
            <div class="timeline-icon">4</div>
            <div class="timeline-content">
              <h3>Maintenance</h3>
              <p>
                Every <strong>6–8 months</strong> — sometimes longer if rarely used — the
                bars must be re-engraved or replaced. Translators return them to Babel’s
                workshops, where the words are refreshed to restore their strength. Neglect
                leads to faltering energy and eventual silence.
              </p>
            </div>
          </div>
      
          <!-- Stage 5: Disposability -->
          <div class="timeline-item">
            <div class="timeline-icon">5</div>
            <div class="timeline-content">
              <h3>Disposability</h3>
              <p>
                When a silver bar cracks or the engravings wear beyond recovery, it becomes
                inert. A spent bar cannot be revived — its once-bright resonance fading to
                dull metal. At this stage, it is discarded or melted down, a relic of
                Babel’s unending hunger for silver.

                            "A brilliant, brutal, and beautiful work that interrogates the costs of power and the price of complicity. Kuang has crafted a masterpiece of speculative fiction that feels both fantastical and urgently real."
